# SQL_Tableau

This project demonstrates the use of SQL and Tableau to analyze and visualize data.
The project is divided into four parts:

A. Creating the Database and Uploading Data
  - Begin by running the 'sample_employee_database.sql' file to create the necessary   
    database structure.
  - This file sets up the employee database and populates the data tables.

B. Executing Queries
  - Run the 'sql_queries.sql' file to execute four different queries, each providing   
    insights from a different perspective.
  - These queries analyze the data and retrieve specific information from the  
     database.
    
C. Exporting Data to CSV Files and Uploading to Tableau Public
  - After executing the queries, the resulting data is exported to CSV files.
  - The CSV files have been uploaded to Tableau Public for visualization purposes.
  - Please note that the CSV files corresponding to each query are also available for      direct use, starting with the file names 'q1', 'q2', 'q3', and 'q4'.

D. Creating Charts and Dashboard
  - The project contains four charts, each representing the insights gained from the   
   corresponding query results. The project also includes a dashboard that combines 
   all four charts together.
  - To view the charts and dashboard visit the Tableau Public project at the following    link:
